# Incoming Webhooks

Every service in Squadcast supports incoming webhooks, also known as the Incident API, using which you can route alerts from monitoring tools or your internal (bespoke) systems into Squadcast. 

Incident Webhook can do both, trigger and resolve incidents in Squadcast, through HTTP POST requests.

Refer [here](https://support.squadcast.com/docs/apiv2#how-to-configure-incident-webhook) about how to set up Incoming webhooks for a service.

Once you have set up the incoming webhooks, you can send events to Squadcast in the payload format below.
