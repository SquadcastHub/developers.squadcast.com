# Use-cases for incoming webhooks

You can use our incoming webhooks to do a lot of things, you are only limited by your imagination. Some of the most common use cases are listed below.

- Route alerts from observability tools
- Route alerts from internal tools
- Capture issues via a webform from internal or external stakeholders and route it to a service using incoming webhooks.

If you use our incoming webhooks for some other use cases, please let us know and we will be happy to update it here.
